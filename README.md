# XamarinNewsApi
Client for http://newsapi.org in Xamarin Forms.

1. Create an application for displaying the news from the BBC feed: https://newsapi.org/bbc-news-api  
2. To use this feed, you'll need to generate an API key. 
3. The application should display a list of the current news with the ability to refresh.
4. Each news item should have title, description, published date and associated image.
5. Selecting a news item should open a link to that story within the app.
6. The only requirement is to use the Xamarin platform, everything else is up to the candidate.
